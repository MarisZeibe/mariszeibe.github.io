                <div><a href="cpu.html">What is a CPU?</a></div>
                <p>
                    A central processor, or CPU, is arguably the most important component of
                    any computing device. It handles basic instructions and allocates the more
                    complicated tasks to other specific chips to get them to do what they do best.
                    It’s the core of your PC, smartphone, or tablet. and it’s what makes the whole
                    device run as it should.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CPU itself is a core component of what makes a computer a computer,
                    but it isn’t the computer itself — it’s just the brains of the operation.
                    It’s a small computer chip that sits atop the main circuit board (motherboard)
                    of a computer, whether that’s a desktop PC, laptop, or tablet. It’s distinctly
                    separate from the memory, which is where information is stored, and the
                    graphics card or graphics chip, which handles all rendering of video and 3D
                    graphics to your monitor or screen.
                </p>

				<div><a href="ram.html">What is RAM?</a></div>
				<p>
					Alternatively referred to as main memory, primary memory, or system memory,
					RAM (random-access memory) is a hardware device that allows information to
					be stored and retrieved on a computer. RAM is usually associated with DRAM,
					which is a type of memory module. Because information is accessed randomly
					instead of sequentially like it is on a CD or hard drive, access times are
					much faster. However, unlike ROM, RAM is a volatile memory and requires power
					to keep the data accessible. If the computer is turned off, all data contained
					in RAM is lost.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the evolution of the computer, there have been different variations of RAM.
					Some of the more common examples are DIMM, RIMM, SIMM, SO-DIMM, and SOO-RIMM.
					Below is an example image of a 512 MB DIMM computer memory module, a piece of
					RAM found in older desktop computers. This memory module would be installed into
					one of the memory slots on a motherboard.

				<div><a href="gpu.html">What is a GPU?</a></div>
				<p>
					GPU stands for graphics processing unit. You’ll also see GPUs commonly referred
					to as graphics cards or video cards. Every PC uses a GPU to render images, video
					and 2D or 3D animations for display. A GPU performs quick math calculations and
					frees up the CPU to do other things. Whereas a CPU uses a few cores focused on
					sequential serial processing, a GPU has thousands of smaller cores made for
					multi-tasking.
				</p>
				<p>There are two different types of GPUs:</p>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Integrated GPUs are located on a PC’s CPU and share memory with the CPU’s processor.
						</li>
						<li>
							Discrete GPUs live on their own card and have their own video memory (VRAM),
							so that the PC doesn’t have to use its RAM for graphics.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<div><a href="mb.html">What is a motherboard?</a></div>
				<p>
					Alternatively referred to as the mb, mainboard, mboard, mobo, mobd, backplane
					board, base board, main circuit board, planar board, system board, or a logic
					board on Apple computers. The motherboard is a printed circuit board and foundation
					of a computer that is the biggest board in a computer chassis. It allocates power
					and allows communication to and between the CPU, RAM, and all other computer
					hardware components.
				</p>
				<p>
					A motherboard provides connectivity between the hardware components of a computer,
					like the processor (CPU), memory (RAM), hard drive, and video card. There are
					multiple types of motherboards, designed to fit different types and sizes of computers.

				<div><a href="psu.html">What is a PSU?</a></div>
				<p>
					The power supply unit is the piece of hardware that converts the power provided
					from the outlet into usable power for the many parts inside the computer case.
				</p>
				<p>
					It converts the alternating current from your wall outlet into a continuous
					form of power called direct current that the computer components require. It
					also regulates overheating by controlling voltage, which might change
					automatically or manually depending on the power supply.
				</p>
				<p>
					The power supply is a crucial piece because, without it, the rest of the
					internal hardware can't function. Motherboards, cases, and power supplies
					all come in different sizes called form factors. All three must be compatible
					to work properly together.
